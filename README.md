# TheVampire-Character-Mod-STS
A mod I am developing that adds a new playable character (The Vapire) with it's own unique cards to the game.
This mod was created using the "DefaultMod" sample mod as a base to start from, so most files with "Default" in the name come from the original base. 
All cards under the "inUse" folder -- excluding DefaultCommonAttack and DefaultCommonSkill -- were designed and coded by myself alone.
